    <h2>AI Boom Sends Hardware Prices Through the Roof</h2>
    <p>
        If you've been shoping for new memory, SSDs or a GPU lately,
        you've probably noticed prices climing quickly. THe massive boom in AI system building
        is consuming hardware stock at an unprecedented rate.

        <h2>Why Everything Costs More</h2>
        <p>AI training rigs and data center clusters are absorbing huge amounts of DRAM, NVMe storage,
            and high-end GPUs. Demand hasn't been this intense since the crypto-mining era, and 
            manufactures are struggling tokeep up.

        <h3>Memory</h3>
        <p>DDR4 price are rising as manufactures shift production to high-bandwidth server memory for AI 
           workloads. Reduced supply for consumers leads to higher costs.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>SSDs</h3>
        <p>AI models require masswive volumes of fast storage. Enterprise NVME drive are being purchased first, which is 
            pushing up consumer SSD prices.

        <h3>GPUs</h3>
        <p>High-end accelerators are sold out for months. Even gaming GPUs are being bought by developers,labs,
            and hobbyists.

        <h2>Impact on System Builders</h2>
        <p>Server builders or CPU builders are experiencing longer leads times,reduced availibility,and increased component costs-especially
            for GPU-accelerated or high-memory systems. Prices are expected to stay eleved until production scales up.
