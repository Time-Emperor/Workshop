    <h2>AI Boom Sends Hardware Prices Through the Roof</h2>
    <p>
        If you've been shoping for new memory, SSDs or a GPU lately,
        you've probably noticed prices climing quickly. THe massive boom in AI system building
        is consuming hardware stock at an unprecedented rate.

        <h2>Why Everything Costs More</h2>
        <p>AI training rigs and data center clusters are absorbing huge amounts of DRAM, NVMe storage,
            and high-end GPUs. Demand hasn't been this intense since the crypto-mining era, and 
            manufactures are struggling tokeep up.

        <h3>Memory</h3>
        <p>DDR4 price are rising as manufactures shift production to high-bandwidth server memory for AI 
           workloads. Reduced supply for consumers leads to higher costs.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>SSDs</h3>
        <p>AI models require masswive volumes of fast storage. Enterprise NVME drive are being purchased first, which is 
            pushing up consumer SSD prices.
        </p>
    </section>   
    <section>
        <h3>GPUs</h3>
        <p>High-end accelerators are sold out for months. Even gaming GPUs are being bought by developers,labs,
            and hobbyists.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Impact on System Builders</h2>
        <p>Server builders or CPU builders are experiencing longer leads times,reduced availibility,and increased component costs-especially
            for GPU-accelerated or high-memory systems. Prices are expected to stay eleved until production scales up.

        <h2>Market Analysis and Long-Term Trends</h2>
        <p>Reports indicate rising prices for DRA, SSDs, NAND flash, and HDDs due to AI workload demands. However, current prices are also being 
           influenced by anticipated future demand and perceived short-term shortages.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>AI Workload Storage Needs</h3>
        <p>AI training requires large datasets. Inference, especially via retrieval-argumented generation (RAG),increases demand for storage capacity.
            This has accelerated demand for both memory and storage products.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Post-COVID Market Recovery</h3>
        <p>After the crash in 2022-2023, demand rebounded in 2024 as inventory was consumed. Manufacturers remain cautions about expanding production capacity
            especially HDD suppliers.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>HDD Shipment Growth</h3>
        <p>Projections show HDD storage capacity shipments in 2030 could be 4x higher than in 2024, driven by increasing drive capacities(from 11TB in 2024 to-47TB in
            2030). <br>
            <br>
            Despite rising prices,current HDD production capacity is sufficient for expected long-term demand.Recent prices increases are influenced by long-term contracts with
            hyperscalers and customers stockpiling in the anticipation of future AI needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Memory Market Cycles</h3>
        <p>DRAM and NAND flash markets historically experience boom-and-bust cycles. Manufacturers ramp up production when prices are high,then scale back once supply floods the market.
            <br>
            <br>
            Semi reports that 300mm wafer fab spending will rise 7% in 2025, with DRAM and NAND investment surging from 2026 to 2028. AI workloads are driving this
             multi-year investyment wave.
